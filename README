# PyQuante2

[PyQuante](http://pyquante.sf.net) is a Quantum Chemistry Suite
written in Python. Over the years, there are many things that I'm
growing increasingly unsatisfied with:

* I learned Python (essentially) as I was writing PyQuante, which
  means that I wasn't as good a programmer when I did most of the
  writing of the core modules as I am now.
* Python was only at version 1.4-2.0 when I started writing. Many
  aspects of the language have changed substantially since then,
  especially the maturity of the numpy module.

I'm playing with PyQuante2 as a way of exploring more intelligent
design. I'm slowly moving components over from PyQuante into
PyQuante2.
